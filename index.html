      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a Sr. Solution Support Specialist at UKG, Inc.  I have tenured experience working various Time and Attendance products. I’m looking forward to utilizing and growing these skills by becoming a Web Developer. </p>

      <p>My hobbies include fitness training, world traveling, and relaxing.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to be a Math Professor.  My favorite subject in school has always been math and it’s something I think is useful in the future.   As a young adult, I would tutor family members and neighbors when they were struggling with mathematics.  Being able to allow individuals to get through their math courses confirmed that not only I knew math, but also able to teach it.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>As we progress towards an ever more tech-filled future, developer skills are increasingly in demand.  With web technology in constant growth, I want to be part of this movement.  Also, I want to gain the knowledge on how to solve issues from the backend as frontend support is limited.</p>
